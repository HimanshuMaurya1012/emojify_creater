# Introduction
Emojis or avatars are ways to indicate nonverbal cues.
These cues have become an essential part of online chatting, product review, brand emotion, and many more.
It also lead to increasing data science research dedicated to emoji-driven storytelling.
 
In this deep learning project, I have classified human facial expressions to filter and map corresponding emojis or avatars.

# Goal
The main aim of this project is to accurately turn human facial expressions into an emoji/avatar.

# Requirements
* Tensorflow
* Python 3.x
* Keras
* OpenCV
* h5py
* A good CPU (preferebly with a GPU).
* Patience....A LOT OF IT!
